    # Example strategy backtests
    
    Here are example notebooks for backtesting. Each of the backtest code can be taken to a live trading strategy as is. 
    The examples vary between from old fashioned technical indicator based algorithms to portfolio construction and DeFi yield optimisation.
    
    Individual backtests:
    
    - [BTC: moving average (MA) strategy](./notebooks/single-backtest/bitcoin-ma.ipynb)
      - Easy complexity
      - One of the simplest technical indicator-based trading strategies there is
      - We buy if the Bitcoin daily close price is above its simple moving average (MA), otherwise sell
    - [ETH: rolling maximum close strategy](./notebooks/single-backtest/eth-10-days-high.ipynb)
      - Easy complexity
      - One of the simplest technical indicator-based trading strategies there is

    - [BTC: An ATR-based breakout strategy for WBTC on Uniswap v3 and Arbitrum](./notebooks/single-backtest/bitcoin-atr-dex.ipynb)
      - Same backtest as above, but using Uniswap price feed instead of a centralised exchange
      - Highlights some of the difference in data quality between DEX and CEX
    - [Multipair 15m: An ATR-based multipair breakout strategy using Binance CEX data](./notebooks/single-backtest/multipair-atr-breakout.ipynb)
      - Same as above

      - Instead of trading a 15-minute timeframe, this backtest trades 1h timeframe with a 24-hour point of interest window
    - [Portfolio construction](./notebooks/single-backtest/portfolio-construction.ipynb)
      - A portfolio construction strategy example
      - Trades anything on Polygon DEXes and contains examples of how to filter out for bad trading pair data

      - Uses TVL and volume inclusion criterias for the index
      - High complexity  
    - [Category active trading strategy: memecoins](./notebooks/single-backtest/base-meme-active.ipynb)
      - A portfolio construction strategy example
      - Trades all memecoins on Uniswap v2 and Uniswap v3 on Base
      - The trading universe is open-ended: trades any token that has been ever listed on Uniswap v3
      - Uses rudimental volatilility and returns indicator with a threhold to buy tokens going up
      - Uses TVL and volume inclusion criterias for the index
      - High complexity    
    - [Alternative data](./notebooks/single-backtest/alternative-data.ipynb)

      - Same as above
      - Includes liquidity risk analysis in the strategy by trading only pairs with minimum liquidity
      - Expands the dataset to include all Polygon pairs and their liquidity data
      - Needs a separate script to prepare the dataset for the backtests
      - High complexity  
    - [Volume-based indicators](./notebooks/single-backtest/eth-mfi.ipynb)
      - An example of using a volume-based indicator, in this case [Money Flow Index](https://tradingstrategy.ai/glossary/money-flow-index-mfi),
        to open and close positions
      - Uses ETH daily price from Uniswap v3 on Ethereum
      - Low complexity
    - [Capacity limitations](./notebooks/single-backtest/capacity-limited.ipynb)
      - An example notebook for a strategy with limited capacity - the strategy cannot deploy all the capital it has
      - The strategy demostrates how to avoid taking too large positions in low liquidity DEX pools
      - The strategy attempts to trade $10M in low liquidity QuickSwap Polygon pools
      - Uses `AlphaModel` and `USDTVLSizeRiskModel` to reduce the size of positions so that it is small % of the overall pool size
      - After the backtest the notebook examines what was the % of the deployed capital of all capital we could have deployed
      - Medium complexity
    
    # Example grid and optimisation searches 
    
    Grid searches run several backtests over multiple strategy parameter combinations.
    This allows you to "brute force search" better strategies and explore the behavior of a strategy with different parameters.
    
    - [Multipair 1h: grid search](./notebooks/grid-search/multipair-atr-breakout-slow.ipynb)
      - Same as `Multipair 1h: An ATR-based multipair breakout strategy using Binance CEX data` above
      - We have converted `Parameters` to individual parameter values to searchable option lists 
      - Grid search over parameters and see if it improves the performance
    
    - [Bollinger Bands BTC 1h: Gaussian Process optimiser](./notebooks/grid-search/btc-bb-1h-binance-optimiser.ipynb)
      - This notebook users Gaussian Process (GP) instead of grid search to find the best strategy parameters
      - Gaussian Process is much faster than brute forcing exhaustive grid search
      - This is using `scikit-optimise` library
      - Setting up optimiser is somewhat more complicate than setting up a grid search
    
    - [Multipair ATR breakout: custom optimisation target](./notebooks/grid-search/multipair-breakout-4h-optimiser-balanced.ipynb)
      - This notebook is using an optimiser with a custom optimisation search function
      - We weight 75% on Sharpe, 25% on Maximum Drawdow
    
    # Example research only notebooks
    
    - [Uniswap CSV export of top 100 pairs](./scripts/uniswap-trading-universe/01-export-csv-uniswap-v2-v3-ethereum-top-100.py)
      - This Python script downloads 1d trading data for all DEX pairs
      - From this dataset we export OHCLV CSV for top 100 most liquid pairs on Uniswap v2 and v3 on Ethereum
      - This CSV can be then imported to the various trading strategy development applications like [RealTest](https://mhptrading.com/) and [MetaTrader](https://mhptrading.com/)  
    - [Uniswap CSV export of top pairs, survivorship-bias free and scam filtered](./scripts/uniswap-trading-universe/02-export-csv-uniswap-v2-v3-ethereum-top-100-sniffed.py)
      - This is more advanced version of the script above
      - This Python script downloads 1d trading data for all DEX pairs
      - From this dataset we export OHCLV CSV for top 100 most historically liquid pairs, instead of today's liquid pairs
      - We will also do a risk scoring check using TokenSniffer to avoid [honeypots and scams](https://tradingstrategy.ai/blog/transfer-fees-token-taxes-and-honeypots)
    - [Uniswap CSV export of top pairs, aggregated liquidity and volume](./scripts/uniswap-trading-universe/03-export-csv-uniswap-v2-v3-ethereum-top-100-sniffed-agg.py)
      - This is more advanced version of the script above
      - This version aggregates volume and liquidity across the same trading pairs 
      - E.g. if the same pair trades on Uniswap v2 and Uniswap v3 different pools with fee tiers, volume and liquidity are aggregated
    - [ADX regime filter research](./notebooks/research/regime-filter-playground.ipynb)
      - This is an indicator visualisation -only notebook for testing different ADX [market regime filter](https://tradingstrategy.ai/glossary/regime-filter) values
      - The notebook will render the regime detection (bull market, bear market, crab market) of various cryptocurrencies
      - The notebook shows how indicators can use data from other indicators using [indicator dependency resolution](https://tradingstrategy.ai/docs/api/execution/help/tradeexecutor.strategy.pandas_trader.indicator.IndicatorDependencyResolver.html#tradeexecutor.strategy.pandas_trader.indicator.IndicatorDependencyResolver)
      - Medium complexity
    - [Regime filter Bayes and Gaussian Proces (GP) optimiser](./notebooks/research/regime-filter-optimise.ipynb)
      - The same as above
      - Finds optimal market regime filter parameters for a certain definition of optimal
      - Uses [scikit-optimize](https://scikit-optimize.github.io/) Python package to find optimal values for a regime filter
      - Demostrates how to integrate `scikit-optimizer` pipeline into the notebooks
      - Uses Gaussian Process (GP) instead of a grid search, being much faster, demostrating the benefits of an optimizer  
      - Advanced complexity

    # How to run on Github Codespaces
    
    In this tutorial, we open a single backtest in Github Codespaces and run it. You can do all in your 
    web browser using your Github account, no software is needed.
    
    Press **Create codespace master** on [Github repository page](https://github.com/tradingstrategy-ai/getting-started)
    (master refers to the primary development branch of Git version control system).
    
    ![](./screenshots/codespaces-button.png)
    
    This will give you a page showing your codespace is being launched.
    
    ![](./screenshots/launching-codespaces.png)
    
    After a while your Github Codespaces cloud environment is set up. The first launch is going to take a minute or two.
    
    ![](./screenshots/codespaces-open.png)
    
    In the file explorer on the left, open a notebook: `notebooks/single-backtest/matic-breakout.ipynb`. 
    
    After opening the notebook click **Clear all Outputs** and then **Run all** button Jupyter toolbar.
    
    ![](./screenshots/jupyter-toolbar.png)
    
    When you are asked to *Select kernel*. Choose *Python Environments..* and then `/usr/local/bin/python`.
    
    ![img.png](./screenshots/choose-kernel.png)
    
    You should see now notebook running, indicated by the progress indicator and run time count down in each notebook cell.
    
    ![img.png](./screenshots/running.png)
    
    After the notebook is running successfully, you should be able to press **Go to** on the toolbar and see the backtesting progress bar going on. 
    You will see a separate progress bar for 1) downloading data (done only once) 2) calculating technical indicators 3) running the backtest.
    
    ![img.png](./screenshots/progress-bar.png)
    
    **Note**: If you see a text `"Error rendering output item using 'jupyter-ipywidget-renderer. this is undefined.` it means Visual Studio Code/Github Codespaces has encountered an internal bug.
    In this case press **Interrupt** on a toolbar, close the notebook, open it again and press **Run all** again. It happens only on the first run.
    
    Shortly after this backtests results are available.
    
    You can find them by scrolling down to the different sections
    
    - Equity curve
    - Performance metrics
    - otehrs
    
    ![img.png](./screenshots/performance-metrics.png)
    
    And now you are done with our first backtest! Continue below to learn more how you can get started with your own strategies.
    
    # Setting up Python environment from command line
    
    Example how to run notebooks and scripts from the command line.
    
    ```shell
    # Get all Python source code we need
    # (A lot of code)
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/tradingstrategy-ai/trade-executor.git deps/trade-executor
    
    # Create virtual environment
    poetry install
    
    # Active Pytohn virtual environment
    poetry shell
    
    # Run script
    python scripts/prefilter-uniswap-v3-ethereum.py
    ```
    
    # Strategy backtest notebook structure
    
    Each strategy backtest notebook will consist of following phases. 
    
    - **Set up**: Create Trading Strategy client that will download and cache any data
    - **Parameters**: Define parameters for your strategy in `Parameters` Python class
    - **Trading pairs and market data**: Define trading pairs your strategy will use and method to construct a trading universe using `create_trading_universe()` Python function.
      This function will take your trading pairs and additional information (candle time frame, stop loss, needed lending rates) and construct Python dataset suitable for 
      backtesting. See documentation.
    - **Indicators**: In this phase, you have `create_indicators` function. You define indicator names, parameters and functions for your strategy.
      Indicators are defined as a separate step, as indicator calculation is performed only once and cached for the subsequent runs.
      See documentation.
    - **Trading algorithm**. Here you define `decide_trades` function that contains the trading strategy logic.
      It reads price data and indicator values for the current `timestamp` of the decision cycle. Then it outputs a list of trades.
      Trades are generic by `PositionManager` of which functions `open_position` and `close_position` are used to open individual trading positions.
    - **Backtest**: This section of the notebook runs the backtest. Here is a progress bar displayed about the current running backtest,
      and any errors you may encounter. We use function `run_backtest_inline()` that gives us the backtest's `state` Python object,
      which contains all the information about the backtest execution we can then analyse.
    - **Output**: You can have various visualisation and tables about the strategy performance. These include e.g. **Equity curve**,
      **Performance metrics** (max drawdown, Sharpe, etc) and **Trading statistics**.
    
    This is a rough skeleton. You mix and match can easily add your own trading signals and output charts using with all tools available in Pandas and Jupyter notebook ecosystem.
    There aren't any limitations on what you can do.

    # Troubleshooting
    
    **Note to Mac users**: The current Docker image is built for Intel platform. If you run Dev Container
    on your Mac computer with Visual Studio Code, the backtesting speed is slower than you would get otherwise. 
    
    - [Rebuilding Dev Containers for Github codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-a-codespace/rebuilding-the-container-in-a-codespace)

    - [Dev Container JSON reference](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/create-dev-container)
    
    Testing the Dev Container build:
    
    ```shell
    devcontainer up --workspace-folder . 
    ```
    
    Checking installed packages wihtin Codespaces terminal:
    
    ```shell
    pip list
    ```
    
    Running the example notebooks using command line `ipython` (useful for debugging)
    
    ```shell
    ipython notebooks/single-backtest/bitcoin-breakout-atr.ipynb
    ```
